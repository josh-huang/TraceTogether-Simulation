right side of sg
lat = 1.357709
lng = 104.031859

left side of sg
lat = 1.320297
lng = 103.631319

top side of sg
lat = 1.466853
lng = 103.807562

bottom side of sg
lat = 1.238607
lng = 103.834116

lng is x
lat is y

lat range = 1.238607 to 1.466853 = 228,246
lng range = 103.631319 to 104.031859 = 40054
